# AirbnbLooksPageviewcontroller
Please use Xcode 7.0 or above to open this project.

This is an Airbnb looks UIPageViewController example.
In the Airbnb app (iOS), there is a "Why Host?" section, which it may implement by using UIScrollView for better animation control.

But I implement this by using UIPageViewController. Because I am learning iOS development, that I want to practice page view controller.

UIPageViewController normally transition between pages with background and text together. But I implement this different, to let text hover on top of the background and transition apart from background. To achieve this effect, make each view of page controller with clear background, and change background of root view controller when transition complete.

Please see the result at below.
